                    <em>To be honest,
                        I know more or less nothing about musicology, and I am certainly not the one in the team who's behind the 
                        topic selection. After a rough start at this project, as the semester went by, all of a sudden, I started coming up with
                        dozens methods to detect tonal ambiguity. It was a really great feeling: I could put numbers and draw conclusions on
                        something I could understand so poorly myself. Below, the abstract of the project and the link to the full text:
                    </em><br><br>

                    Claude Debussy reformed the traditional paradigm of the functional tonality. He achieved a feat of
                    floating and elusive vagueness in his compositions, that this paper refers to as ambiguous tonality.
                    Debussy’s piano music evolved from tonal clarity to a tonally ambiguous harmony in his later pieces.
                    The aim of this paper is to study this shift using computational methods. We hypothesize that the
                    shift is characterized by increased use of symmetric structures, fragmented forms, and pentatonic
                    rather than diatonic scales. Wavescapes, a method based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), is the
                    central tool of this project to visualize and analyze tonal hierarchies in musical pieces. The
                    harmonic structure of several piano pieces of Debussy is analyzed using wavescapes, acknowledging
                    their strengths and limitations. We propose a number of statistical methods that are designed specifically
                    for the task, to validate and problematize our hypotheses. The results are in line with the initial
                    hypotheses, allowing us to computationally define Debussy’s tonal ambiguity and visualize its
                    development in time.

                <em>An excert from our case studies: </em>This piece marks "one of Debussy’s most extreme essays in discontinuity",
                 painting a picture of ambiguity: it consists of gestures and motivic cells more than themes,
                 all of them frequently juxtaposed without any continuity. The different sections are often outside 
                 of a clear key centre. However, under the surface of seemingly fragmented music lies a meticulously 
                 organised construction. Func60 tional relationships dissolve and become subordinate to new pitch-set interactions. 
                 This occurs not as a program62 matic purpose of explicitly rejecting tonality but instead as a consequence of the colours,
                 sonorities, moods em64 ployed to evoke the "Ondine" ’s character. Referring to "Ondines", Anthony Aubrey Tobin states: 
                 "The dichotomy between real and imaginary realms ascribed to mythology is a symbolic link to the conflict between 
                 vestigial references to tonality and total dissolution." This contrast is musically represented on
                 different layers. The piece is based on the conflict between the two whole-tone scale poles and between 
                 related octatonic segments. Utilising common pitches and introducing extraneous notes in scale fragments, 
                 the music moves to different pitch sets to create new means of forward motion. Combining the two poles and octatonic
                 sets determines the emergence of the diatonic sets, such as the D-Lydian lyrical theme (interpretable as a fusion
                  of the two whole77 tone poles: D-E-F-G + A-B-C) or the final D section. On a large scale, the piece exhibits 
                  symmetrical Rondo form, arising from the combination of octatonic and whole-tone structures, which expresses the 
                  contrast between the natural and supernatural world.
