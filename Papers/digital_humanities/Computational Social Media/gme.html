                        This one was about understanding the dynamics of GME's short squeeze, about
                        evaluating how much this phenomenon really came from the masses and whether the masses
                        came first or the short squeeze did. Below, some excepts of the introduction and
                        the full text: </em><br><br> Communities on social media have the power to affect large-scale social movements since social media allows people to connect far beyond their local communities, and with unprecedented
                    speed. In this paper, we investigate the role of a community on the social media platform Reddit, r/WallStreetBets (r/WSB), in the short squeeze of the publicly traded stocks of GameStop, a retailer of video games with physical stores
                    across the world. In January 2021, the stock prices of GameStop ($GME stock) saw a bizarre price movement. Whereas the stock had consistently traded for less than $10 over the previous year, the price rose meteorically, peaking at
                    $347. Being a physical retailer in the age of giant digital game distributors such as Steam and Epic Games, GameStop was widely regarded as a relic of the past and predicted to slowly fade into irrelevance.[...] Our interest in the
                    $GME short squeeze revolves around understanding the dynamics of the Reddit community (called a subreddit in Reddit terminology). [...] This introduces our first research question: whether the /r/WallStreetBets community is dominated
                    by a few highly influential individuals, or whether the community is more egalitarian and influenced by a larger number of members. For our second research question, we ask whether the actors in the subreddit were actually responsible
                    for the short squeeze, and whether the publicly available information from the subreddit can be used to measure the impact of the subreddit on price fluctuations of $GME.<br><br> For the full text: <a href='GMEMoonBase.pdf'>here</a>.
