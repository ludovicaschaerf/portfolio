                    Communities on social media have the power to affect large-scale
                    social movements since social media allows people to connect far
                    beyond their local communities, and with unprecedented speed.
                    In this paper, we investigate the role of a community on the
                    social media platform Reddit, r/WallStreetBets (r/WSB), in the short
                    squeeze of the publicly traded stocks of GameStop, a retailer of video
                    games with physical stores across the world.
                    In January 2021, the stock prices of GameStop ($GME stock)
                    saw a bizarre price movement. Whereas the stock had consistently
                    traded for less than $10 over the previous year, the price rose meteorically, peaking at $347 [17].
                    Being a physical retailer in the age
                    of giant digital game distributors such as Steam and Epic Games,
                    GameStop was widely regarded as a relic of the past and predicted
                    to slowly fade into irrelevance (parallels exist to the decline of the
                    video rental chain Blockbuster, being supplanted by video streaming
                    services such as Netflix).
                    There were two major factions betting on $GME. On one side,
                    hedge funds had made short contracts amounting to more than
                    140% of $GMEâ€™s stocks [1]. On the other side, prominent members
                    of the r/WallStreetBets community encouraged retail investors to
                    buy the stock en masse, believing it to be undervalued [6]. During
                    the ensuing price spike, it is reported that short sellers lost over $6
                    billion [1]. While long term stock holders from the Reddit community made significant gains, a large
                    number of Reddit users who
                    entered the market near the peak have suffered large losses.
                    Our interest in the $GME short squeeze revolves around understanding the dynamics of the Reddit
                    community (called a subreddit
                    in Reddit terminology). To counter the billions invested by hedge
                    funds, the investments from the subreddit would have to match
                    it. Given the limited means of retail investors, a large number of
                    them would have to pool resources to cause the short squeeze, as
                    often claimed [6, 17]. Or the short squeeze might also have been
                    driven and orchestrated by a few financially strong actors. This introduces our first research
                    question: whether the /r/WallStreetBets
                    community is dominated by a few highly influential individuals,
                    or whether the community is more egalitarian and influenced by a
                    larger number of members.
                    For our second research question, we ask whether the actors in
                    the subreddit were actually responsible for the short squeeze, and
                    whether the publicly available information from the subreddit can
                    be used to measure the impact of the subreddit on price fluctuations
                    of $GME.<br><br>
