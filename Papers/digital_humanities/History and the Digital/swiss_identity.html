                    The XIX century in Europe is, among others, defined by the emergence of the nation state
                    as exemplified by the German (1871), Italian (1870) and Swiss nation (1848). Whereas
                    the French, English, German or Italian nations emerged either from a preceding dynastic
                    power over a given geographic territory or a common language, ethnicity and culture 1
                    ,
                    Switzerland constitutes a special case2
                    .
                    For most of its history, Switzerland was a loose federation of different city-states or small
                    independent regions bound together by a military entity called the Swiss confederation.
                    Thus, Swiss people preferably identified with their local region, canton, or even city than
                    with the Swiss confederation for a long time.
                    However, during the last two centuries, a Swiss identity arguably emerged, aided by
                    shared military service, education, historical education, and common values. This “growing together”
                    was also manifested in the growth in central authority (implementation of
                    national pension schemes and inter-cantonal transfers; Ladner and Mathys (2018)).
                    Due to their exceptional stance, Swiss nationalism and national identity have been
                    discussed by a rich body of literature from different scientific communities. In our analysis,
                    we would like to contribute to this general discussion by tracing the evolution of Swiss
                    national identity from the XIX century using computational methods. Specifically, we
                    consider the period from the 1820s to the 1950s, when the formation and development
                    of the modern Swiss Nation took place. This analysis aims to articulate the concept of
                    Swiss nationality in a computer-understandable manner and to scan the vast corpus of
                    regional Swiss newspapers for its evolution in time. Newspapers have been chosen as, we
                    believe, they largely reflect and model the opinions and topics of interest to the regional
                    population. To the best of our knowledge, the adoption of newspapers as a primary source
                    has not yet been considered in the analysis of Swiss nationality and could hopefully provide
                    new insights into the matter.
                    The investigation will comprise two parts: the extraction of expressions that identify
                    Swiss identity and the temporal evolution of how these expressions were used in the selected
                    newspapers. For the extraction, we adopt several textual sources that can serve as proxies
                    of national identity. Those proxies are: 1) Early Swiss history books. 2) World War I
                    propaganda articles in newspapers. 3) Political sociology papers on (Swiss) nationalism.
                    Although all presented proxies are inherently biased, by looking at the question from several
                    angles and taking different proxies into account, this paper aims to produce meaningful
                    and robust results.
