                    <em>For my master thesis I worked in the Digital Humanities Lab of the university. It was my first time working in an actual lab so I went there with excitement every single day (including most weekends). I was working on an already existing project, the Replica Project. I needed to conduct the step from an image retrieval model (where an input image is needed) to clustering, that suggests by itself new findings. The step was exciting and every new finding I annotated I felt a great sense of purpose. 
                    </em> <br><br> The project Replica, about six years ago, paved the way to computational studies of visual patterns in art history. Simultaneously, it created the possibility for art historians to trace the propagation
                    of patterns throughout the history of art. During the project, an image retrieval network was set up to discover artistic patterns given an input image. Despite successfully serving monographic needs and targeted search attempts, the
                    network does not propose spontaneous discoveries. In this thesis, we eliminate the middle man of the input image, creating clusters of artworks sharing a common pattern propagation. The clusters are integrated further with a 2D coordinate-based
                    visualisation, which provides an organic view of the evolution of the patterns in art history. In this effort, we demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-tuning deep learning models on a set of visual connections using a compound Hinge
                    loss and ResNeXt architecture. Moreover, we show that clustering the trained visual signatures with OPTICS yields remarkable precision. We emphasise the importance of the semi-supervised learning of the clusters, proving the qualitative
                    and quantitative improvement over generic clustering methods. Furthermore, we close the loop of the semi-supervised clustering through the annotation of the new findings in the clusters proposed, and retraining thereof. In total, we
                    add over 700 new images to the set of slightly over 1800 existing visual connections. We find, in addition, examples of cross-domain, architectural, design and sketch based patterns, which were previously outside the scope of the known
                    visual connections.

                <em>An excerpt of the discussion: </em> Writing a thesis in Digital Humanities may sometimes feel like walking on a rope. It comes with the awareness that developing methods for art historians should not be blind to art history and should
                stem from a comprehension of the art historical task, of its motivation and of its application, and an intuition of the quality of the results. At the same time, it should also be technically advanced, because a technically trained person
                should bring this value to the table. I admit, however, that I have fallen from the rope a few times.
