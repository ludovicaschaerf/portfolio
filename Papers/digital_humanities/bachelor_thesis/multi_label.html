                    <em>My bachelor thesis was the first time that I applied my then very limited
                        deep learning knowledge to arts. I had noticed that normal deep learning
                        applications to the analysis of art were rather limited to stylistic applications.
                        I.e., can we detect the painter? the historical period? the technique? etc. What I wanted to
                        do was to see whether 'AI' could abstract over style and eventually
                        understand the representational intent of an artist. Below you can find the abstract and links
                        to how I ended up tackling this problem.
                    </em> <br><br>

                    As the field of Computer Vision develops, new applications of its techniques need
                    to be investigated. One of these is the automatic recognition of icons represented in
                    artworks. To the best of our knowledge, this task has not yet been comprehensively
                    tackled using Deep Learning classification methods on a dataset of classic, modern,
                    and contemporary artworks. To fill this gap, this paper uses different multi-label and
                    transfer learning techniques to classify the artworks in the Tate Collection Dataset
                    (Archive & Access Project) into their content. In this paper, artworks will be classified into 15
                    general icons
                    based not only on the recognition of physical elements in an artwork but abstract
                    concepts such as Religion & Belief as well. In Appendix 1, we show some preliminary
                    results on 141, more specific, classes using hierarchical methods. The best model,
                    CNN-RNN, achieves a mean per-class precision of 0.57 and a per-class accuracy of
                    0.83.
                    The automatic generation of iconographical metadata will contribute to enrich the
                    indexation of artworks, allowing to search paintings by content rather than only
                    by artist, style and period, as most websites offer now. On a broader level, these
                    experiments will allow us to trace some conclusions on the ability of current machine
                    learning techniques to recognise the content of artistic depictions: Are the models
                    able to extrapolate the manner in which objects are depicted in art? Can they
                    understand how specific abstract themes and concepts are represented?

                <em>An excerpt of the introduction: </em> Take as an example Figure above.
                The representation of the object in the images varies incredibly. The picture on the left has few
                elements of variance, pertaining to the natural variation in the object types, its exposure, pose and
                inclination (the full paper has an extra image on the left).
                Already in Caravaggioâ€™s depiction, the variance increases: some parts are voluntarily
                shaded to create a theatrical effect, chiaroscuro on the instrument is sketched but
                not completed. In Picasso, the depiction is much more abstract: it is fragmented
                and bi-dimensional, hardly recognisable to the rookie eye.
