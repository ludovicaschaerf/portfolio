                    <em>I have recently worked on this project for my internship in Data Science for Digital Humanities.
                        While research in the sciences has always seemed quite doable to me - most resources are
                        open access, the articles are short and clearly structured, whenever I have to do research
                        in the SSH, I have the impression that I cannot get the full picture of what is available and
                        what a certain book is about (before I buy it). This is what I am trying to improve in this
                        project.
                        The project was constructed from scratch by me and is still at a beta version and is being continuously updated.

                    </em><br><br> The Social Sciences and Humanities Platform project (SSH Platform) consists of the creation of a prototype platform dedicated to Social Sciences and Humanities publications. Its aim is to enrich the
                    experience of researching publications, increasing the accessibility and interest in both the backlist and front-list. The platform should make the research experience deeper and broader, using: 1. The enrichment and polishment of
                    the metadata, 2. the increased indexability and overview information of the publications, 3. the interactive visualizations in the search results.
                    <br><br> For the documentation: <a href='http://sshplatform.peterlang.com/index.php?docs=True'>here</a>.

                <em>Some excerpts from the beginning of the document: </em><br><br> The search<br> At the current state of the prototype, on the top right of the landing page the user can see a search box. Using this box, one can search into all the publications
                published by Peter Lang. The search can be a word as well as a full sentence or a couple of words. The top 250 relevant publications are displayed based on the publications whose Title, Subtitle, Main Description, Author’s Biography, Index
                terms and Most important terms[1] contain the search phrase (entirely or with small typos). For example, we can search for the word ‘media’. The result page looks as above. There are three visualizations on top of the search page. The
                search results (on the right) and filters (on the left) are on the bottom of the page. The search results (the list of resulting publications with their metadata) are used to generate the three visualizations and the filters. The filters
                are made as follows: the 5 most recurrent entries in the fields Year, Authors, Version, Subject group, Division, Language appear for each field. As an example, if we have 250 publications in the results, 50 of which are from the year 2018,
                21 from 2013, 20 from 2019, 10 from 2020, 8 from 2011 and 5 from 2002 and 3 from 2000 etc, we will use only the first 5 as possible filters (as in the image above) for the filter Year. The results are listed one after the other in order
                of Relevance (based on how similar the search term is to the information on the title). This can be changed to Date, from most recent to least, selecting the option Date after Sort by. <br>

                <br>The visualizations<br> The three visualizations are meant to give an overview, at first glance, of the search results. This overview is slightly different from the one we are used to. Normally, a user would scroll through the search
                results, reading their Title, Subtitle and, often, Description and basing the choice of which book select on this information. In this prototype, each visualization offers one or a few original factors to gather information from and base
                the choice on. Seeing each visualization as a whole should also encourage users to make connections between books and determine general trends among them. The metadata for each visualization has been extracted from different fields such
                as Main Description and Author’s Biography when we did not already have it in the metadata (i.e. Location, Time Period, Affiliation)
