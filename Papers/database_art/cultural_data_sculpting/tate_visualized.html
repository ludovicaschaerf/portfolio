                    In this project, modern and contemporary artworks are visualized according to the subjects they represent.
                    This is done using the Tate Modern dataset, containing Avantgarde artworks which are indexed using the
                    Subject index. This metadatum encodes the content of the artworks (i.e. People, Interiors, etc) in a
                    hierarchical three-layer deep structure.
                    The concept is to reverse the navigation of art from the frequently used painter/year/title navigation to a
                    semantic one. The peculiarity is that the art used is weakly representational or even abstract. Although
                    this effort is almost contradictory in nature as this art has a tendency to move away from a pure semantic
                    identification, this aggregation opens up new perspectives and new ways of looking at this art. It generates
                    a reflection on the side of the user into which forms and colors in Avantgarde art can still determine its
                    content. Practically, the visualization is articulated along the z-axis, navigating hierarchically the
                    structure of the index. The starting page features 14 slideshows in a grid with slightly staggered boxes (as
                    in Figure 1). Each slideshow contains the images of one of the subjects at the first level and the animation
                    selects randomly a box that is updated at any time.
        
        
                    Double-clicking on one of the slideshows surpasses it in the z-axis. The choice of a subject is purely based
                    on the visual slideshow as no text is given at this point. The second page then appears with slideshows of
                    the sub-subjects of the second level (in the same way as the first). Double-clicking opens the third scene
                    which contains the full list of images in the sub-subjects. These can be ordered by creation year, artist,
                    acquisition year and medium. Double-clicking on another image finally reveals the metadata on the image,
                    including which subjects and sub-subjects of the index are present in the image. At this point, the user has
                    information on what are the possible subjects and sub-subjects they have clicked to get there and are
                    encouraged to continue browsing the other images (going back with 'b') to determine which slideshow
                    represents which subjects and sub-subjects.

            In short, the intent of this visualization is to exploit the possibilities opened up by the Subject index on
            Modern and Contemporary art. As art belonging to the Avantgardes of these last two centuries witnesses often
            a detachment from forms and colors, the contenutistic and symbolic aspects of this art become progressively
            less directly associated with the forms and colors used to depict them. By presenting artworks organized by
            their index (and therefore their content), this project aims to stimulate the user into understanding what
            forms and colors are distinctive of certain contents. It aims to do so for Avantgarde art, as this
            association of forms and colors to contents is weak.
