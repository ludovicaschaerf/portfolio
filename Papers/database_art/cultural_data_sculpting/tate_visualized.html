                    <em>After my <a href='../../digital_humanities/bachelor_thesis/multilabel.html'>bachelor thesis</a>, for which I worked on the Tate dataset, 
                    I developed the curiosity to see how the same concept of finding artworks by their icons could be dealt with differently by technology.
                    The answer came with this project. I had never used javascript nor any other visualization frameworks other than python before, but 
                    I could express at least my intention with this visualization: can humans organize artworks by their content in their head?
                    Can they recognize a cluster of paintings about humans when they see it? Below are some excerpts of the introduction to the project. </em><br><br>
                    
                    NB: To explore the visualization click on the info button and follow the instructions. It is highly advised to double click only after
                    blocking the animation. <br>

                    In this project, modern and contemporary artworks are visualized according to the subjects they represent.
                    This is done using the Tate Modern dataset, containing Avantgarde artworks which are indexed using the
                    Subject index. This metadatum encodes the content of the artworks (i.e. People, Interiors, etc) in a
                    hierarchical three-layer deep structure.
                    The concept is to reverse the navigation of art from the frequently used painter/year/title navigation to a
                    semantic one. The peculiarity is that the art used is weakly representational or even abstract. Although
                    this effort is almost contradictory in nature as this art has a tendency to move away from a pure semantic
                    identification, this aggregation opens up new perspectives and new ways of looking at this art. It generates
                    a reflection on the side of the user into which forms and colors in Avantgarde art can still determine its
                    content. Practically, the visualization is articulated along the z-axis, navigating hierarchically the
                    structure of the index. The starting page features 14 slideshows in a grid with slightly staggered boxes (as
                    in Figure 1). Each slideshow contains the images of one of the subjects at the first level and the animation
                    selects randomly a box that is updated at any time.

            <em> Some excerpts from the text: </em> The intent of this visualization is to exploit the possibilities opened up by the Subject index on
            Modern and Contemporary art. As art belonging to the Avantgardes of these last two centuries witnesses often
            a detachment from forms and colors, the contenutistic and symbolic aspects of this art become progressively
            less directly associated with the forms and colors used to depict them. By presenting artworks organized by
            their index (and therefore their content), this project aims to stimulate the user into understanding what
            forms and colors are distinctive of certain contents. It aims to do so for Avantgarde art, as this
            association of forms and colors to contents is weak.
