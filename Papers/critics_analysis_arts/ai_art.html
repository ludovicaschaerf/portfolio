                    <em>This essay was written for an academic writing class. I could choose absolutely anything 
                        I wanted to research and it was around the time that I had first come across AI-generated 
                        art. The topic elicited my curiosity so I wrote the essay on it. Below is the abstract of the essay and the full text:
                    </em><br><br>
                    Artificial Intelligence Generated Artworks (AIG-Artworks) have recently entered the art
                    market and have been profitably sold at auction houses such as Christieâ€™s. Although this
                    phenomenon is still at an embryonic stage, a foundational analysis on the aesthetic value of
                    such artworks will soon become necessary. This paper performs this aesthetic judgement on
                    the beauty of AI Generative Art (AIG-Art), adopting a tripartite view of aesthetic judgements:
                    as comprised of judgements on free, dependent and intellectual beauty. Each of these aspects
                    is evaluated: the free beauty of these artworks is deemed equatable in terms of parameters to
                    any human generated art. Both dependent and intellectual beauty are, however, considered
                    impossible to judge according to the same meters of human art as these algorithms do not
                    create an explicit semantic representation of their art. For this reason, the paper suggests
                    allowing for judgements a posteriori of the interaction between the artwork and the audience:
                    judgements on the imagined experience of the viewer. To conduct this analysis, the essay first
                    examines the literature on the current generative frameworks and on the aesthetics of beauty.
                    The first successful generative framework appeared only in 2014 with Goodfellow et al. and
                    many have been the adaptations and improvements to the latter. Ever since, academics have
                    extensively analyzed the aesthetic potential of AI machines as artists, but have overlooked the
                    potential of the artwork itself. The findings of this research imply that the former approach
                    centered on the artist is improductive and that attention should be shifted to the audience and
                    to the artwork itself.<br><br>
