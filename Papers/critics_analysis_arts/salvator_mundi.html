                    The painting Salvator Mundi, attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, was auctioned by Christie’s in
                    2017 and sold for 450.300.000$ to an anonymous buyer, breaking the world record for the
                    most expensive painting ever sold (Davis, 2017). However, when we look at the fame of the
                    Mona Lisa, it does not come as a surprise that it is a Leonardo to open the ground for this
                    new era in the art market.
                    Copious articles (Davis, 2017; Gammon, 2017) investigate the reasons behind this inflated
                    price, adducing the motives, among others, of provenance, mystery, exiguity of Da Vinci’s
                    paintings, and even the election of Donald Trump. To complement these various accounts,
                    this paper explores the role of branding and post-modern commodification in the creation of
                    the value of the aforementioned work. In particular, to provide a justification to this post
                    factum branding, it connects the ‘case of the Salvator Mundi’ to the themes discussed by
                    Hughes in the documentary The Mona Lisa Curse (2008).
                    In other words, the essay uses the case study of the Salvator Mundi to attempt to answer the
                    question of ‘what creates the value of an artwork in our contemporary society’. In this regard,
                    the case of the Salvator Mundi is particularly interesting. Not only is it, up to this date, the
                    most expensive painting ever sold, but it successfully entered and prevailed in a market of
                    contemporary artworks. Keeping this in mind, the question can be reworked into ‘what is the
                    reason for which a Renaissance painting fits so well among ‘Warhols’?’.
                    To answer the question, the essay adopts the theoretical framework provided by Tomiuc
                    (2015) in her dissertation on Branding in the Artworld, which, in turn, adopts the concept
                    introduced by Danto and renewed by Becker of the ‘art worlds’. In later paragraphs, the
                    paper draws concepts from the Mona Lisa Curse (2008), the Van Gogh Effect (Heinich,
                    1996), and finally from the Cultural Diamond and Olav Velthuis’ view of the market (2005).
                    The structure of the paper is comprised of three sections, each of them responding to an
                    element of the thesis of the essay - that the branding of Da Vinci’s paintings is at the basis of
                    its inflated price. The first part responds to the question of ‘why Da Vinci and the Salvator
                    Mundi in particular are suitable to be branded and commodified’, the second one
                    investigates ‘why the painting is to be considered as branded and commodified’ and the last
                    part provides some ideas into ‘why nowadays society values branding in art’.
