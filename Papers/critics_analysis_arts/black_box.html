                    <em>When two machine learning / deep learning models perform the same predictions, but one is 
                        a white box (say a Logistic Regression) and one is a neural network. How can we tell whether 
                        the two algorithms are the same? This essay tries to answer this question. Below are some 
                        excerpts of the Introduction and the full text:
                    </em><br><br>
                    Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence’ (AI) procedures that classify as ‘black boxes’ are at the
                    basis of most of the algorithms used by our devices. Such procedures, albeit classifying the
                    data with high precision and accuracy, consist of a decision-making process that is - almost
                    always - uninterpretable and unexplainable. This issue has opened the debate both in
                    industries and elsewhere of whether it is safe, or at least ethical, to rely so extensively on
                    algorithms that lack in accountability (Molnar, Christoph., 2019). This debate is particularly
                    central when concerning high-risk situations that have not been fully understood by previous
                    researches (Doshi-Velez and Kim 2017). A controversial instance of this are AI self driving
                    cars: if we consider a scenario in which the car is faced with the decision of either killing the
                    people crossing the road or derailing and killing the passengers of the car, it is
                    retrospectively essential to be able to account for the decision-making process of the AI.
                    In contribution to this debate, this essay explores the notion of equivalence of algorithms,
                    focusing on whether their interpretability and explainability are aspects that must be taken
                    into account when making judgements on equivalence.
                    In the analysis, the concept of equivalence is explained both philosophically and in computer
                    science terms, and translated into the problem of reducibility of an algorithm into the other
                    and into the Halting problem. Finally, the paper argues in favour of a conception of an output
                    as an entity that expresses the concept of the algorithm it has been produced by, entailing
                    that the equivalence in outputs of two algorithms fails when the concept of one cannot be
                    recreated.<br><br>
