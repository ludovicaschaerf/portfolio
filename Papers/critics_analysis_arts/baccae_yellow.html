                    <em>During my last year of high school, for my Ancient Greek class, we translated and studied the full
                        Euripedian tragedy The Baccae. The more I studied of it, the more fascinated I became. When for this
                        class we read The Yellow Wallpaper, I couldn't believe how similar degeneration was to The Baccae.
                        So I wrote this essay to explore it. Below some excerpts of the introduction and the full text:
                    </em><br><br> ‘I don’t like to look out of the windows even-there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast. I wonder if they all come out of the wall-paper as I did?’ (Gilman, 1899): You might
                    be wondering why I opened my paper with these lines from The Yellow Wallpaper, and more precisely why I chose some of the most obscure lines of the book. To your disappointment, it is not because I have deciphered their truest and
                    deepest meaning, but because the more you will read of this essay, the more you will realize how much of it you haven’t understood. The critics Hurley (1996), Karschay (2015), Mighall (2003) and Collins (2016) all treated the theory
                    of degenerationism as an historical construct that arose from the affirmation of the theories of Darwin but also of Lamarck, Lombroso and Morel (Mighall, 2006). However, they all failed to analyze the nature of the link between the
                    spread of these theories and the rise of the degenerationist theory in literature. For this reason, this paper elaborates on the nature of this relationship, proposing that what the critics seem to refer to as a causation is rather
                    only a force that shaped and triggered the affirmation of degenerationism in the 19th century. More specifically, this essay proposes that the ‘gothic body’ ought not be considered as the main and only explication of degenerationism
                    in literature, but rather as one of the forms in which this universal anxiety of men is expressed. To do so, the text examines as a case study the tragedy Bacchae by Euripides in light of the concepts of degeneration and heredity as
                    they have been defined by contemporary critics (in particular Hurley, Karshay and Mighall). Parallels and points of separations are then drawn between the greek tragedy and The Yellow Wallpaper following the constituent elements of
                    the theory of ‘entropic bodies’ as outlined by Hurley (1996): ‘Heredity was not a vehicle of progress: it was an invisible source of contamination, with the infection jumping across bodies, across generations, and manifesting itself
                    in visible physical deformity’ 1
