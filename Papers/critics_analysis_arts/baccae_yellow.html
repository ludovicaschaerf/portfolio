                    ‘I don’t like to look out of the windows even-there are so many of those creeping women, and
                    they creep so fast. I wonder if they all come out of the wall-paper as I did?’ (Gilman, 1899):
                    You might be wondering why I opened my paper with these lines from The Yellow
                    Wallpaper, and more precisely why I chose some of the most obscure lines of the book. To
                    your disappointment, it is not because I have deciphered their truest and deepest meaning, but
                    because the more you will read of this essay, the more you will realize how much of it you
                    haven’t understood.
                    The critics Hurley (1996), Karschay (2015), Mighall (2003) and Collins (2016) all
                    treated the theory of degenerationism as an historical construct that arose from the
                    affirmation of the theories of Darwin but also of Lamarck, Lombroso and Morel (Mighall,
                    2006). However, they all failed to analyze the nature of the link between the spread of these
                    theories and the rise of the degenerationist theory in literature. For this reason, this paper
                    elaborates on the nature of this relationship, proposing that what the critics seem to refer to as
                    a causation is rather only a force that shaped and triggered the affirmation of degenerationism
                    in the 19th century. More specifically, this essay proposes that the ‘gothic body’ ought not be
                    considered as the main and only explication of degenerationism in literature, but rather as one
                    of the forms in which this universal anxiety of men is expressed.
                    To do so, the text examines as a case study the tragedy Bacchae by Euripides in light
                    of the concepts of degeneration and heredity as they have been defined by contemporary
                    critics (in particular Hurley, Karshay and Mighall). Parallels and points of separations are
                    then drawn between the greek tragedy and The Yellow Wallpaper following the constituent
                    elements of the theory of ‘entropic bodies’ as outlined by Hurley (1996):
                    ‘Heredity was not a vehicle of progress: it was an invisible source of contamination, with
                    the infection jumping across bodies, across generations, and manifesting itself in visible
                    physical deformity’ 1
                    Accordingly, the paper is outlined as follows: to provide grounding on the claims of
                    the subsequent paragraphs, the essay commences with a research context on how
                    degeneration, the gothic body and atavism have been envisaged by critics (Hurley, 1996,
                    Karschay, 2015, Mighall, 2003 and Collins, 2016), but also introduces one auxiliary text on
                    The Yellow Wallpaper (Rodríguez Salas, 2012) and a brief introduction to Euripides’ tragedy,
                    1 my italics
                    1
                    accompanied by some influential critical works on the latter (Bierl, 2013, Dodds, 1963, Goff,
                    2004, Jeanmaire, 1951, Saxonhouse, 2014). The successive paragraph offers evidence that
                    ‘reversed evolution’ in literature is not a conception limited the 19th century but rather
                    universal, present, for instance, even in ancient texts. The essay concludes with highlighting
                    the specificities of its emergence in the fin-de-siècle gothic by analysing the role of science in
                    literature and juxtaposing it to religion in literature.<br><br>
