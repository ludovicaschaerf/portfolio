                    <em> To rewrite: Exploring and criticizing possible futures by creating fictional, and often provocative,
                        scenarios
                        presented
                        through tangible artefacts.
                        spark conversations about the near future, check the sanity of their visions and uncover hidden
                        perspectives.
                        What could be the new relationships we could build with animals in urban contexts of the near
                        future? What are its "faint signals”: ingredients and stimuli for building design fiction: the signals of change from
                        which you extrapolate?

                    </em><br><br>

                    The idea is grounded in the social, it is a psychological reaction to the ever growing presence of
                    pigeon in the urban environment. This might create certain a fascination and unsettlement in humans, that try
                    to explain their emotion by means of a religion. Some ‘faint signals’ of this change can be seen in the
                    figure of the old man feeding pigeons. This figure is affine to those of frugal and mysterious monks. This
                    religion  constitutes the discovery of a new relationship between men and urban animals, that shifts from
                    carelessness to veneration.
                    The idea is also culturally grounded on the idea of birds are divinatory animals.

                    
                    The format is typical of religions. The design is used to convey the worship basis of this religion: it
                    is a transcendental religion that spans over all well grounded religions. Pigeons appear in all religions
                    as  saviours, we can take the example of christianity that sees the dove as the holy spirit. For all
                    this time  we have not realized that all these religions were correct, but their focus was off. The real god
                    they were depicting as the Pigeon. He is the only animal that inhabits cities as well as countrysides, this is
                    because it is close to all living forms and it guides them through life.

            <p><br>

                After experimenting with different styles, eventually decided to adopt the styles of the religions that
                this creed is based on, this time shifting the attention to the role of the pigeon. Even in the drawings and
                the scripture, these were roughly copied from the religions and adjusted to place the pigeon at the
                centre. This was also justified by the fact that this religion was not rationally originated, while it was the
                result of a human pulsion, the style is not coherent (take for instance pastafarians) and it is not uniform.


                The context was chosen to mimic the activity of many of these newborn religions that do proselytism
                in the streets. This format is easy to relate to and it should immediately link this religion to those the
                design fiction aims at criticizing.
