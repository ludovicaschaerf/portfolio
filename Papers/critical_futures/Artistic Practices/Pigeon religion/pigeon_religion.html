                    Exploring and criticizing possible futures by creating fictional, and often provocative, scenarios
                    presented
                    through tangible artefacts.
                    spark conversations about the near future, check the sanity of their visions and uncover hidden
                    perspectives.

                    What could be the new relationships we could build with animals in urban contexts of the near
                    future?
                    "faint signals”: ingredients and stimuli for building design fiction: the signals of change from
                    which you
                    extrapolate, something curious you observe from time to time that may become a norm in the future

                    id='imkg'-->

                    The idea is grounded in the social, it is a psychological reaction to the ever growing presence of
                    pigeon in
                    the urban environment. This might create certain a fascination and unsettlement in humans, that try
                    to
                    explain their emotion by means of a religion. Some ‘faint signals’ of this change can be seen in the
                    figure
                    of the old man feeding pigeons. This figure is affine to those of frugal and mysterious monks. This
                    religion
                    constitutes the discovery of a new relationship between men and urban animals, that shifts from
                    carelessness
                    to veneration.
                    The idea is also culturally grounded on the idea of birds are divinatory animals.

                    The formats you chose should preferably be rich enough to demonstrate your idea AND highlight
                    potential
                    opportunities, problems or controversies raised by it.
    
                    Picture of the two santini and of the cartellone
    
                    Format is typical of religions. The design is used to convey the worship basis of this religion: it
                    is a
                    transcendental religion that spans over all well grounded religions. Pigeons appear in all religions
                    as
                    saviours, we can take the example of christianity that sees the dove as the holy spirit. For all
                    this time
                    we have not realized that all these religions were correct, but their focus was off. The real god
                    they were
                    depicting as the Pigeon. He is the only animal that inhabits cities as well as countrysides, this is
                    because
                    it is close to all living forms and it guides them through life.

                Experimented with different styles, eventually decided to adopt the styles of the religions that
                this creed
                is based on, this time shifting the attention to the role of the pigeon. Even in the drawings and
                the
                scripture, these were roughly copied from the religions and adjusted to place the pigeon at the
                centre. This
                was also justified by the fact that this religion was not rationally originated, while it was the
                result of
                a human pulsion, the style is not coherent (take for instance pastafarians) and it is not uniform.


                please take a photo (or a short video) of the design fiction you created IN CONTEXT

                put picture of Davide approaching someone with pigeons in the back.

                The context was chosen to mimic the activity of many of these newborn religions that do proselytism
                in the
                streets. This format is easy to relate to and it should immediately link this religion to those the
                design
