                    <em> This project explores and criticizes possible futures by creating a fictional, and provocative, scenario.
                        It is meant to spark conversations about the near future, check the sanity of the vision and uncover hidden
                        perspectives. What could be the new relationships we could build with animals in urban contexts of the near
                        future? What are its "faint signals”: ingredients and stimuli for building design fiction: the signals of change from
                        which you extrapolate? This is the prompt of the project, and below its realization. 

                    </em><br><br> The idea is grounded in the social sphere, it is a psychological reaction to the ever growing presence of pigeons in the urban environment. This presence might create a certain fascination and unsettlement
                    in humans. Humans in history have tried to explain their emotions by means of a religion. We can already see some ‘faint signals’ of this change in the figure of the old man feeding pigeons. This figure is affine to that of a frugal
                    and mysterious monk. In the future, this could evolve into a religion of the pigeon. This would constitute the discovery of a new relationship between men and urban animals, that shifts from carelessness to veneration. The idea is
                    also culturally grounded on the idea of birds are divinatory animals.

                    <br> The format is typical of religions: a religious flier. The design is used to convey the worship basis of this religion: it is a transcendental religion that spans over all well grounded religions. Pigeons appear in all religions
                    as saviours, we can take the example of christianity that sees the dove as the holy spirit. For all this time we have not realized that all these religions were correct, but their focus was off. The real God they were depicting is
                    the Pigeon. He is the only animal that inhabits cities as well as countrysides, this is because it is close to all living forms and it guides them through life.

            <p><br>

                After experimenting with different styles, I eventually decided to adopt the styles of the religions that
                this creed is based on, this time shifting the attention to the role of the pigeon. Even in the drawings and
                the scripture, these were roughly copied from the religions and adjusted to place the pigeon at the
                centre. This was also justified by the fact that this religion was not rationally originated, while it was the
                result of a human pulsion. The style is not coherent and it is not uniform.


                The context was chosen to mimic the activity of many newborn religions that do proselytism
                in the streets. This format is easy to relate to and it should immediately link to newborn religions trying to spread their popularity.
