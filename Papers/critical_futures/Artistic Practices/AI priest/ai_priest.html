                    This project is comprised of 4 elements. The main and overarching product is the Substack newsletter
                    feed of
                    our favorite priest, 'Religion&Tech'. The second newsletter contains the second element: a video
                    with
                    artificial audio of our priest giving the mass. The third newsletter, similarly, contains the third
                    element:
                    a new page of the Bible, containing the chapter finale written by AI. Lastly, each newsletter
                    received some
                    comments from the user testers, playing different roles and identifying oneself with some specific,
                    stereotypical point of view. This is the last element.





                    These four elements concur to create a reflective environment on the intersection between Artificial
                    Intelligence and Religion. Being the liturgy still heavily reliant on out-of-context readings of the
                    Bible,
                    understanding becomes problematic for people who do not attend every Sunday Mass or cannot read the
                    full
                    Scriptures. In addition, after the readings, the priest begins his Homily, giving an interpretation
                    of the
                    mass and the readings. This often is extremely allegorical and abstract. In this issue, and many
                    others,
                    Artificial Intelligence can come to the rescue of Religion. AI can summarize what comes before the
                    readings
                    in the Scriptures, and it can do so without the allegorical or personal interpretations of the
                    priests. The
                    two explanations (the AI and the priest-made ones) can therefore complement each other and provide
                    believers
                    with the tools they need. The reflective environment is therefore intended to stimulate a reflection
                    on the
                    use of an AI-made summary of some passages of the Bible before the liturgy.


                    Consequently, the project envisages an Italian priest opening a newsletter in 2030 (2050) to suggest
                    his
                    idea: to post, every Saturday, a summary of the events preceding the readings of the following
                    Sunday mass.
                    These summaries are be made by AIs for efficiency reasons and to provide an unbiased and objective
                    summary
                    of the piece. Further, these are enacted on a video of a mass, where
                    the priest's voice is substituted by an AI-generated voice reading the summary made by AI. With this
                    goal in
                    mind, the priest publishes a second newsletter. This time showing a real prototype of
                    of what he has in mind by that. He publishes a video of the priest of the Diocesi di Mantova, whose
                    audio
                    has been substituted with the neural voice created with https://voicemaker.in/. The words read by
                    the neural
                    voice are a summary of the beginning of the 24th chapter of Luke's Gospel that has been summarized
                    by
                    https://quillbot.com/summarize.

                    Moving to the third element, the priest, after months of activity in the newsletter, suggests his
                    final
                    vision. He envisages a new perspective for AI: the creation of new words of God. Using
                    https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator, the priest creates a new ending of the
                    passage
                    summarized in the second newsletter. The priest is now completely hyped about AI and cannot see its
                    limits
                    any longer. He believes that the new means of communication of God can only be through AI, which
                    will be
                    able to write Godly words as it is not tainted by human sin.

                More explicitly, this project aims to raise some crucial questions about AI and Religion:
                Can AI help popularize the liturgy, extending its understanding to sporadic churchgoers?
                Is an AI summary more unbiased than a human one? Would this ‘solve’ the issue of interpretation?
                Can AI interact with the Sacred? Would this be profane?
                Will the vast use of AI distance us from reality? For example, in a future where we will read mostly
                texts
                produced by AIs, will we be further away from reality?
                Will we be able to trust a summary by an AI, especially if we cannot read the full text to double-check
                for
                ourselves?

                The last post specifically aims to raise a final issue: that of the AI hype. AI is being used for the
                vastest aspects of our lives, but:
                Why do we think that it is appropriate to apply it to so many areas?
                Why are people so hyped by it that apply it with great trust even if they do not understand how and why
                it
                works?

                The implications of this union are much more vast than those mentioned above, however, if we want to
                start
                understanding what is happening in the application of AI to so many disciplines, this is a good thought
                experiment for all.
