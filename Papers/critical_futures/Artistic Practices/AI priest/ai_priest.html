                    <em>Can AI help popularize the liturgy, extending its understanding to sporadic churchgoers?
                        Is an AI summary more unbiased than a human one? Would this ‘solve’ the issue of interpretation?
                        Can AI interact with the Sacred? Would this be profane?
                        Will the vast use of AI distance us from reality? For example, in a future where we will read
                        mostly
                        texts produced by AIs, will we be further away from reality?
                        Will we be able to trust a summary by an AI, especially if we cannot read the full text to
                        double-check
                        for
                        ourselves?
                        Why do we think that it is appropriate to apply AI to so many areas?
                        Why are people so hyped by it that apply it with great trust even if they do not understand how
                        and why
                        it
                        works?
                    </em><br><br>

                    This project consists of a the Substack newsletter feed of 'Religion&Tech'.

                    The feed constains elements that concur to create a reflective environment on the intersection
                    between Artificial
                    Intelligence and Religion. Being the liturgy still heavily reliant on out-of-context readings of the
                    Bible, understanding becomes problematic for people who do not attend every Sunday Mass or cannot
                    read the
                    full Scriptures. In addition, after the readings, the priest begins his Homily, giving an
                    interpretation
                    of the mass and the readings. This often is extremely allegorical and abstract. In this issue, and
                    many
                    others, Artificial Intelligence can come to the rescue of Religion. AI can summarize what comes
                    before the
                    readings in the Scriptures, and it can do so without the allegorical or personal interpretations of
                    the
                    priests. The two explanations (the AI and the priest-made ones) can therefore complement each other
                    and provide
                    believers with the tools they need. The reflective environment is therefore intended to stimulate a
                    reflection
                    on the use of an AI-made summary of some passages of the Bible before the liturgy.


                    Consequently, the project envisages an Italian priest opening a newsletter in 2030 (2050) to suggest
                    his idea: to post, every Saturday, a summary of the events preceding the readings of the following
                    Sunday mass.

                These summaries are be made by AIs for efficiency reasons and to provide an unbiased and objective
                summary
                of the piece. Further, these are enacted on a video of a mass, where
                the priest's voice is substituted by an AI-generated voice reading the summary made by AI. With this
                goal in
                mind, the priest publishes a second newsletter. This time showing a real prototype of
                of what he has in mind by that. He publishes a video of the priest of the Diocesi di Mantova, whose
                audio
                has been substituted with the neural voice created with <a href=https://voicemaker.in/> voicemaker </a>.
                The words read by
                the neural voice are a summary of the beginning of the 24th chapter of Luke's Gospel that has been
                summarized
                by <a href=https://quillbot.com/summarize> quillbot.</a>.

                The priest, after months of activity in the newsletter, suggests his
                final
                vision. He envisages a new perspective for AI: the creation of new words of God. Using
                <a href=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator>deepai text generator</a>, the priest
                creates a new ending of the
                passage
                summarized in the second newsletter. The priest is now completely hyped about AI and cannot see its
                limits
                any longer. He believes that the new means of communication of God can only be through AI, which
                will be
                able to write Godly words as it is not tainted by human sin.
