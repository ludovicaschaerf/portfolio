            <em>
                These projects were carried out when I was working as a Senior AI Developer 
                in a Zurich-based start-up called Art Recognition. These were part of the 
                several improvements that we made with the team to the AI-based Authentication
                techniques of the company. The research includes two publications, the first exploring
                the possibility of using Vision Transformers for art authentication and the second 
                that of Generative AI. The first paper was published on Neural Computing and Applications and 
                the second on PlosONE. What follows is the abstract of the second publication: 
            </em><br><br> 
            Previous research has shown that Artificial Intelligence is capable of distinguishing
            between authentic paintings by a given artist and human-made forgeries with
            remarkable accuracy, provided sufficient training. However, with the limited amount of
            existing known forgeries, augmentation methods for forgery detection are highly
            desirable. In this work, we examine the potential of incorporating synthetic artworks
            into training datasets to enhance the performance of forgery detection. Our
            investigation focuses on paintings by Vincent van Gogh, for which we release the first
            dataset specialized for forgery detection. To reinforce our results, we conduct the same
            analyses on the artists Amedeo Modigliani and Raphael. We train a classifier to
            distinguish original artworks from forgeries. For this, we use human-made forgeries and
            imitations in the style of well-known artists and augment our training sets with images
            in a similar style generated by Stable Diffusion and StyleGAN. We find that the
            additional synthetic forgeries consistently improve the detection of human-made
            forgeries. In addition, we find that, in line with previous research, the inclusion of
            synthetic forgeries in the training also enables the detection of AI-generated forgeries,
            especially if created using a similar generator.
