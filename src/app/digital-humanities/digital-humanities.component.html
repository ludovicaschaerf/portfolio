            <em>To be honest,
                I know more or less nothing about musicology, and I am certainly not the one in the team who's behind the 
                topic selection. After a rough start at this project, as the semester went by, all of a sudden,
                dozens of methods to quantify tonal ambiguity started coming to our minds. It was a really great feeling: I could put numbers and draw conclusions on
                something I could understand so poorly myself. After this, the two TA's of the course offered to help to turn this into a paper. 
                They helped so much and I am so grateful. We have presented this work at two conferences and the full paper has been published on Nature Humanities and Social Sciences.
                We even won the best poster presentation award! Below, the abstract of the project and the link to the full text:

            Claude Debussy’s personal style is typically characterised as a departure from earlier diatonic tonality, including a greater variety of pitch-class materials organised in fragmented yet
             coherent compositions. Exploiting the music-theoretical interpretability of Discrete Fourier Transforms 
             over pitch-class distributions, we performed a corpus study over Debussy’s solo-piano works in order to
              investigate the diachronic development of such stylistic features across the composer’s lifespan. We 
              propose quantitative heuristics for the prevalence of different pitch-class prototypes, the fragmentation 
              of a piece across different prototypes, as well as some aspect of the overall coherence of a piece.
               We found strong evidence for a decrease of diatonicity in favour of octatonicity, as well as for an 
               increase of fragmentation accompanied by non-decreasing coherence. These results contribute to the 
               understanding of the historical development of extended-tonal harmony, while representing a fertile
                testing ground for the interaction of computational corpus-based methods with traditional music
                 analytical approaches.

        <em>An excerpt from our case studies: </em>This piece marks "one of Debussy’s most extreme essays in discontinuity", painting a picture of ambiguity: it consists of gestures and motivic cells more than themes, all of them frequently juxtaposed
        without any continuity. The different sections are often outside of a clear key centre. However, under the surface of seemingly fragmented music lies a meticulously organised construction. Functional relationships dissolve and become
        subordinate to new pitch-set interactions. This occurs not as a programmatic purpose of explicitly rejecting tonality but instead as a consequence of the colours, sonorities, moods employed to evoke the "Ondine"’s character. Referring
        to "Ondines", Anthony Aubrey Tobin states: "The dichotomy between real and imaginary realms ascribed to mythology is a symbolic link to the conflict between vestigial references to tonality and total dissolution." This contrast is musically
        represented on different layers. The piece is based on the conflict between the two whole-tone scale poles and between related octatonic segments. Utilising common pitches and introducing extraneous notes in scale fragments, the music
        moves to different pitch sets to create new means of forward motion. Combining the two poles and octatonic sets determines the emergence of the diatonic sets, such as the D-Lydian lyrical theme (interpretable as a fusion of the two whole
        tone poles: D-E-F-G + A-B-C) or the final D section. On a large scale, the piece exhibits symmetrical Rondo form, arising from the combination of octatonic and whole-tone structures, which expresses the contrast between the natural and
        supernatural world.
